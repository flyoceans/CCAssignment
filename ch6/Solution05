Fullfill the five-quart jug firstly, and then pure it to the 3-quart jug, so we get 2-quart water left in the 5-jug, and we clear the water in 3-quart jug.
Move the rest water of 5-quart jug to 3-quart jug, at that time 3-jug would have one quart volume empty. Fullfill the five-quart jug again and pure it to fullfill the 3-jug, after that we will have 4-quart water left in the five-quart jug.
