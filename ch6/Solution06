If there is only one blue-eyed people in the island, then he will leave at the first night because he would see that other people are all non-blue so he would know himself is the one. 
If there are two blue-eyed people, nobody would leave first night because they cannot figure out the blue-eye. Blue-eyed people would leave at the second night,because as soon as they see nobody leave at first night, and each of them only see one blue-eyed, so they would know themselves are blue-eyed, and then they gonna leave. 
The rest may be deduced by analogy, so the number of days that blue-eyed people would equal their amounts.
