6.1
Marking all the bottles as #1-20, and we could pick one pill from bottle #1, two pills from bottle #2 and k pills from #k until k = 20. Then we measure the amount weights of those pills. 
As we know, only one bottle have 1.1 grams of pills, so if we check difference between the amounts weights, say W, and 210(1 + 2 + ... 20 = 210g), we would know the tag of bottles.
	tag = (W - 210)*10
